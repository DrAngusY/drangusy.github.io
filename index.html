<H1>Do Not Make These Mistakes When Selling Your Homes in Silicon Valley</H1>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
I am not providing any legal advice to anyone.  I am sharing hard-earned key learnings with you so you won't repeat the same mistakes we made.
</p>

<H2>Key Learnings:</H2>

<li  style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Be alerted if an agent offered you any free service.</strong> An agent is a salesperson. Some agents are unethical and they will lure you into signing a listing agreement by overpromising future services, mispresenting or hiding some material facts.  Make sure that you write down everything an agent promised to you, no matter how your agent looks innocent or helpless.</li>
<BR>
<li  style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Be careful with big realty firm.</strong> A big realty company got sued a lot.  So they have their in-house lawyers to save legal cost.  For an agent in big firms, it is free of charge for the agent to sue you, while you as a consumer are unprotected. Do not put yourself in such assymmertical disadvantage.  Agents in big realty firm pay higher portion of their commission to their broker.  In return, they will be happy to use the free legal tools provided by the firm.  Don't blindly trust the brand name just because you have seen the name before.  Go to this firm's review page on Yelp and check out your agent and the firm's reputation yourself.</li>
<BR>
<li  style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Do you have to remodel your house before selling it?</strong> Some agents will point out a lot of nasty things about your property and shame you into doing remodeling before putting your property on the market.  Listing agents have incentive to sell your property for higher price but higher selling price may not justify your cost of remodeling.  They are after "fame", because if they can sell a house for a higher price in a neighborhood they rake in more business, AND they want to use your investment into the remodeling as a way to hook you up.  Use your own judgement.  If you are in a red hot seller's market, watch out when an agent pitches the idea of remodeling to you. Do you own ROI analysis and do this independently.</li>
