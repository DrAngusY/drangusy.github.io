<H1>Do Not Make These Mistakes When Selling Your Homes in Silicon Valley</H1>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
I am not providing any legal advice to anyone.  I am sharing hard-earned key learnings with you so you won't repeat the same mistakes we made.
</p>

<H2>Key Learnings:</H2>

<li  style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Be alerted if an agent offered you any free service.</strong> An agent is a salesperson. Some agents are unethical and they will lure you into signing a listing agreement by overpromising future services, mispresenting or hiding some material facts.  Make sure that you write down everything an agent promised to you, no matter how your agent looks innocent or helpless.</li>
<BR>
<li  style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Be careful with big realty firm.</strong> A big realty company got sued a lot.  So they have their in-house lawyers to save legal cost.  For an agent in big firms, it is free of charge for the agent to sue you, while you as a consumer are unprotected. Do not put yourself in such assymmertical disadvantage.  Agents in big realty firm pay higher portion of their commission to their broker.  In return, they will be happy to use the free legal tools provided by the firm.  Don't blindly trust the brand name just because you have seen the name before.  Go to this firm's review page on Yelp and check out your agent and the firm's reputation yourself.</li>
<BR>
<li  style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Do you have to remodel your house before selling it?</strong> Some agents will point out a lot of nasty things about your property and shame you to do remodeling before selling.  Listing agents have incentive to sell your property for higher price but higher selling price may not justify your cost of remodeling.  They are after "fame", because if they can sell a house for a higher price in a neighborhood they rake in more business, AND they want to use your investment into the remodeling as a way to hook you up.  Use your own judgement.  If you are in a red hot seller's market, watch out when an agent pitches the idea of remodeling to you. Do you own ROI analysis.</li>

<H1>Case Study: Our Experience with Jessie Li at Intero Los Altos</H1>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
<strong>Jessie Li</strong>, <strong>Scott Chase</strong> and the Intero Office at Los Altos are terrible and unethical.  They do not care about their reputation, blatantly overpromise and under deliver, blatantly break the fiduciary relationship, neglect the client's concern, go against their client's interest and bully their client.
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
Jessie Li at Intero used project management of remodeling projects to lure homeowners to sign the listing agreement with her, despite the fact that she has no professional experience with city's code in remodeling.  She gave us a tour to another remodeling project and pitched how she takes care of an absentee owner in the remodeling project.
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
My wife was on medical leave and I belong to the high risk group for Covid.  We wouldn't have started a remodeling project ourselves and put our property on market.  <strong>Jessie Li really took advantage of our vulnerabilities to lure us into signing the listing agreement.</strong>
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
After the listing agreement was signed, the agent immediately became very busy and her contractor became very expensive and we had to chase after her to get things started. She refused to provide any scope, budget estimate, and quality for project managing the remodel.  The remodeling became a money sink and the contractor ran away due to miscommunication and mismanagement, leaving our property uninhabitable causing many months of vacancies. She simply dropped the ball and stopped communicating with us.
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
We called Scott Chase, the Intero office to sort things out.  Warren Kohn - he claimed to be two-in-a-box with Scott Chase - called us back. We made a complaint to him and requested to cancel the listing agreement.  He told us, "No one will force you to sell your property." and promised to get back to us in a week, which he never did.
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
The next thing is an offer, <strong>about 1 week before the listing agreement expired</strong> and two months after our request for cancelling the listing.  The buyer agent told us that Jessie Li told her to write up a formal offer in order for her client to see the property.  Of course we rejected this offer. (Why would someone entertain an off market offer in this super hot market?) We made a complaint to Scott Chase, Jessie's broker, but he simply shouldered off his responsibility: "<i>Jessie is an independent contractor,  I did not speak for her regarding her actions.  I can only advise her.</i>" and "<i>just let the listing agreement expire.</i>"
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
One day before the listing agreement expired, the Intero office sent us <strong>a demand letter blackmailing us for commission: $155,xxx</strong>. They will only agree to cancel the listing agreement if we pay the commission by the following day on which the agreement expires, simply because we leased out the property without their consent unknowingly.
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
Jessie Li boasted, "<i>It costs me nothing for the in-house lawyer.  You go through her (Intero in house counsel) to resolve the matter. I don't need this commission - I make a lot.</i>"
</P>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
As you can see, we were being set up by a professional to owe them commission. <strong>They know how to abuse the legal system to bully the consumer.</strong>  It's free for her to use her free in-house lawyer and she is determined to rack up legal fees for her clients in her bitter revenge.  All these unethical behavior by Jessie Li, Scott Chase, and Intero Office should not be condoned.
