Jessie Li, Scott Chase and the Intero Office at Los Altos are terrible and unethical.  They do not care about their reputation, blatantly overpromise and under deliver, blatantly break the fiduciary relationship, neglect the client's concern, go against their client's interest and bullies their client.
</P>
<P>
Jessie Li at Intero used project management of remodeling projects to lure homeowners to sign the listing agreement with her, despite the fact that she has no professional experience with city's code in remodeling.  She gave us a tour to another remodeling project and pitched how she takes care of an absentee owner in the remodeling project.
</P>
<P>
My wife was on medical leave and I belong to the high risk group for Covid.  We wouldn't have started a remodeling project ourselves and put our property on market.  Jessie Li really took advantage of our vulnerabilities to lure us into signing the listing agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the listing agreement was signed, the agent immediately became very busy and her contractor became very expensive and we had to chase after her to get things started. She refused to provide any scope, budget estimate, and quality for project managing the remodel.  The remodeling became a money sink and the contractor ran away due to miscommunication and mismanagement, leaving our property uninhabitable causing many months of vacancies. She simply dropped the ball and stopped communicating with us.
</P>
<P>
We called Scott Chase, the Intero office to sort things out.  Warren Kohn - he claimed to be two-in-a-box with Scott Chase - called us back. We made a complaint to him and requested to cancel the listing agreement.  He told us, "No one will force you to sell your property." and promised to get back to us in a week, which he never did.
</P>
<P>
The next thing is an offer, about 1 week before the listing agreement expired and two months after our request for cancelling the listing.  The buyer agent told us that Jessie Li told her to write up a formal offer in order for her client to see the property.  Of course we rejected this offer. (Why would someone entertain an off market offer in this super hot market?) We made a complaint to Scott Chase, Jessie's broker, but he simply shouldered off his responsibility: "<i>Jessie is an independent contractor,  I did not speak for her regarding her actions.  I can only advise her.</i>" and "<i>just let the listing agreement expire.</i>"
</P>
<P>
One day before the listing agreement expired, the Intero office sent us a demand letter blackmailing us for commission: $155,xxx. They will only agree to cancel the listing agreement if we pay the commission by the following day on which the agreement expires, simply because we leased out the property without their consent unknowingly.
</P>
<P>
Jessie Li boasted, "<i>It costs me nothing for the in-house lawyer.  You go through her (Intero in house counsel) to resolve the matter. I don't need this commission - I make a lot.</i>"
</P>
<P>
As you can see, we were being set up by a professional to owe them commission. They know how to abuse the legal system to bully the consumer.  It's free for her to use her free in-house lawyer and she is determined to rack up legal fees for her clients in her bitter revenge.  All these unethical behavior by Jessie Li, Scott Chase, and Intero Office should not be condoned.
